The [custom templating](/examples/custom-templating) and [jinja templating](/examples/jinja-templating) pages offer a glimpse of the capabilities of `FastHX`.

For complete, but simple examples that showcase the basic use of `FastHX`, please see the [examples](https://github.com/volfpeter/fasthx/tree/main/examples) folder.

If you're looking for a more complex (`Jinja2`) example with features like active search, lazy-loading, server-sent events, custom server-side HTMX triggers, dialogs, and TailwindCSS and DaisyUI integration, check out this [FastAPI-HTMX-Tailwind example](https://github.com/volfpeter/fastapi-htmx-tailwind-example).
