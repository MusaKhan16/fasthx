# From v1 to v2

Version 2 added exception rendering as the main feature, which required some API changes. Here is how you should upgrade your code to be compatible with version 2:

- If you have custom `RequestComponentSelector` implementations, then please add the new argument to the `get_component_id()` method. Well-behaved `RequestComponentSelector`s that don's support error rendering should reraise the received error if it's not `None` (although not doing so will not break anything as result and errors are clearly separated in `Jinja` and the core decorators don't rely on this protocol).
- If you've overridden any of the protected methods of `Jinja`, please go through this PR so you can upgrade your custom implementation.
